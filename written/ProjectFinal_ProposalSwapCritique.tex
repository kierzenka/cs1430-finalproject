\section*{Critique Instructions}

You should have received an email from the STAs with an anonymous proposal from another team. 

Please read the other team's proposal, and analyze it to list at least 5 socially-responsible computing concerns. 

These could be direct responses to their answers to the SRC prompts, new aspects that you think the team missed, or something else. Each concern should be described in 1-2 sentences.

For each additional reasonable concern expressed beyond 5, you will earn +0.5 extra credit points on your final project grade [up to 5 points total].
